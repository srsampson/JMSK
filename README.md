# JMSK
An MSK modem written in C++ Qt

![windows screenshot v1.1.0](images/screenshot-win-v1.1.0.png)

This program can demodulate and modulate MSK (*minimum shift keying*) signals. Demodulation is performed using the soundcard, while modulation can be either via the soundcard or the via an external device to RF (*Radio Frequency*) frequencies using some simple hardware as described in the [JDDS-Arduino](JDDS-Arduino) section.

The demodulator implements a coherent MSK demodulator type as seen at http://jontio.zapto.org/hda1/msk-demodulation2.html.

The demodulator uses the technique that treats the signal similar to [OQPSK] but with sine wave transitions rather than rectangular transitions. The BER (*Bit Error Rate*) versus EbNo (*Energy per bit to Noise power density*) performance in the presence of AWGN (*Additive White Gaussian Noise*) is the same as coherently demodulated differentially encoded [BPSK]. While designed for MSK it will also demodulate [GMSK]. The signal is supplied via the audio input of the computerâ€™s soundcard.
The software implements differential decoding hence the modulator must use differential encoding. The demodulator can decode varicode encoded text. The output of the demodulator can be directed to either a built-in console or to a [UDP] network port.

The modulator can either output audio frequency MSK to the soundcard which is suitable for devices such as [SSB] transmitters that can be controlled via serial PTT (*push to talk*), or alternatively can be connected to simple hardware such as consisting of an [Arduino] and an AD9850 module as described in the [JDDS-Arduino](JDDS-Arduino) section to directly modulate RF waves.

There is currently no interleaving or FEC (*Forward Error Correction*) and therefore is compatible with other applications that can modulate MSK with [Varicode] such as [Spectrum Lab]. This is convenient for testing and comparison purposes.

## Directory structure

The [JMSK](JMSK) directory is where the Qt pro file is for the main application. The [udptextserver](udptextserver) directory is a small demo application for receiving data sent from JMSK. The [JDDS-Arduino](JDDS-Arduino) directory contains both the source code and hardware design for a device (called a JDDS device) that can connect to JMSK to output MSK modulated RF frequencies.

## Compiling JMSK

Compiling JMSK requires the Qt framework which can be obtained from http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ . Qt Creator can be used to compile JMSK and comes with the Qt framework. At least version 5 of the Qt framework is required. Currently MinGW and GCC work as compilers but VC++ does not.

After installing Qt download the JMSK zip or the tar.gz source file to your computer. No other third-party downloads should be required.

Open the [JMSK/JMSK.pro](JMSK/JMSK.pro) file with Qt creator where by Qt should ask you a few simple questions as to how to build JMSK. finally click build then run.
